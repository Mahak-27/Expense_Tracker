# Expense_Tracker
This is a simple, Java-based application that allows users to monitor and manage their personal expenses easily. It almost contains all the features of this tool, such as adding new expenses, viewing all recorded expenses, generating the total cost incurred for them, and even performing a search from descriptions of an expense. It also provides weekly and monthly reports to help the user know what he is spending most on.

The tracker allows the user to set expense targets both for the week and the month. If expenses reach or exceed 90% of these targets, it will issue a warning. The user can also delete expenses; file storage ensures data persistence. Since the application reads and writes its expense data in CSV files, it saves both expenses and targets between sessions.
